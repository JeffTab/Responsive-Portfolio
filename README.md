# Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

This is a sample of what my portfolio *could* look like with responsiveness.  But probably not.  While this uses html and css, like my last sample portfolio, this one includes Bootstrap.  Bootstrap make sizing for different screen a lot easier.  That was really what this was all about, a strong introduction to Bootstrap.

I certainly learned a bunch about Bootstrap.  My favorite part was dealing with rows and columns.  It feels like a much easier way to layout a page.  However I had trouble with the nuances, moving this a little bit over, aligning these two unrelated divs.  It felt much easier with css.  However, coding out the premade objects was much easier than figuring it out myself.  A navbar that collapses into the whatever it's called feels like it would take me a long time to code on my own.  Yikes.

Overall, I don't really feel like I have any more solid of a grasp on Bootstrap than I did before I started this homework.  It's not that I don't feel confident, this homework assignment simply didn't go much further than the in-class assignments.  I'm sure it won't matter after I've done this many more times.  Hooray.

## The rest

Feel free to use this on any size page; it should accommodate and look pretty similar everywhere it can be seen.  Anyone is free to use this in anyway they choose, but try to refrain from cheating.
